## User Stories 
### MVP Goals 
> As a user, I want to be able to see a crypto currency's information such as price, volume, market cap so i'm informed on it's key metrics.
> As a user, I want to see analytics of the overall crypto market as a whole so I get the information I need quick.
> As a user, I want to be able to search cryptocurrencies which will then display crypto currecy info so I can see it if readily displayed so I avoid scroll and searching with my eyes through hundreds of cryptocurrencies. 
> As a user, I want to be able to see the information of multiple cryptocurrencies at once so I don't have to run the app multiple times.
### Stretch Goals 
> As a user, I would like to be able to place the screen in night mode which darkens the screen so I don't strain my eyes while browsing at night and use too much battery.
> As a user, I would like to see crypto and overall market news on the homepage so Ii'm aware of current market conditions.
> As a user, I would like to only see the latest news headlines so that i'm not viewing outdated news.

# Blockchain Buzz
Blockchain Buzz is a hub for cryptocurrency financial metrics and trending general cryptocurrency news. Whether it's viewing the price and market cap of popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or skimming the latest cryptocurrency news, we have you covered with one place. Now buzz over to Blockchain Buzz!

## Motivation
As a Cryptocurrency enthusiast and investor, there are various websites I frequent to view cryptocurrency prices and news. However, these two are not normally found together and as a result in order to be well informed I have to visit multiple financial and news websites. Blockchain buzz solves this minor annoyance of mine and I can now go to just one website.

## User Stories 
### MVP Goals 
- As a user, I want to be able to see a crypto currency's information such as price, volume, market cap so i'm informed on it's key metrics.
- As a user, I want to see analytics of the overall crypto market as a whole so I get the information I need quick.
- As a user, I want to be able to search cryptocurrencies which will then display crypto currecy info so I can see it if readily displayed so I avoid scroll and searching with my eyes through hundreds of cryptocurrencies. 
- As a user, I want to be able to see the information of multiple cryptocurrencies at once so I don't have to run the app multiple times.
### Stretch Goals 
- As a user, I would like to be able to place the screen in night mode which darkens the screen so I don't strain my eyes while browsing at night and use too much battery.
- As a user, I would like to see crypto and overall market news on the homepage so Ii'm aware of current market conditions.
- As a user, I would like to only see the latest news headlines so that i'm not viewing outdated news.
